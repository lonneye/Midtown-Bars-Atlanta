		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been on a quest to to visit every Bar in MidTown for 5 years now. Let me share this knowledge with you.</p>
		<p> On this site I visit, analyze and rate different bars. I have gone to 26 bars in Midtown ATL , and the number is only growing. 
		Atop, you can see where I've organized bars by types.For example, the category for bars with a strong food presence will have sections for 
		bars with superb pizza, desserts, burgers, etc. There's a section for bars that have strengths in their food, creative drinks, and atmosphere
		(which may have a single or date night focus). </p>
		<p>Regardless of what brings your lip to the glass, you'll find the perfect bar for your outing here</p>
